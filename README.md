# Superslider
Max 4 Live device to interpolate parameters

## What?
Parameter interpolation is very powerful, because it lets you map out the sonic space your sound should stay in, and then explore the in-betweens.
To make this even more interesting, Superslider has slow envelopefollowers for every parameter, which creates more lively transitions of the preset state.
