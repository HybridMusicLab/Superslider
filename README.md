# Superslider
Max 4 Live device to interpolate parameters

## What?
Superslider is directly inspired by the preset-interpolation slider of the GRM Tools, which allowed you to crossfade smoothly between presets using interpolation. The GRM in France has a long history of using this technique, dating back to 1984 to Syter, the first realtime preset interpolation system.

Parameter interpolation is very powerful, because it lets you map out the sonic space your sound should stay in, and then explore the in-betweens.
To make this even more interesting, Superslider has slow envelopefollowers for every parameter, which creates more lively transitions of the preset state.
